Tweets are stored via inserting into a mongodb. 
Connection to the mongodb is established, a collection is either referenced or created, then all tweets are inserted via iterable batch form.

Once tweets are stored, expanded urls (twitter naming convention) are retrieved/queried in an article text downloading workflow. Article text/html is then stored in a different collection within the mongodb along with a reference ID to the original tweet.

#collections are created upon initial insertion into them at run time

#db.collections.insert_many() takes an iterable as argument... returns an instance of InsertManyResult from which I can query (as an attribute) the list of _ids inserted into the collection

#iterate through every single document within the tweets collection, extract the expanded_url text (if there is one), then download that text and store the text into a different collection - the 'articles' collection within same db

#treat the collection as an iterable and index for 'expanded_url'

#QUERYING TWEETS in MONGO
#attempt to search by objectID ... ObjectId("5c4cf54faf41c1250e094b2f")

nltk.download() # will display a dialogue box, click on download all nlp library/packages
article.nlp() #subsequent attributes this creates: summary and keywords
article.summary
#this may be a word frequency hierarchy
article.keywords

#STRATEGY: ideally each of the attributes and results of the nlp is also stored in the database, aside from author, date, source... can also manually build a tldf rank
#variables to mine from each article:
#word frequency/histogram

#Often a simple bigram approach is better than a 1-gram bag-of-words model for tasks like documentation classification.

#ARTICLE COLLECTION CREATION
#iterate through each document in the 'tweet' collection and if there is an expanded url, use the newspaper.Article library to extract the text... will also need to store the tweet document ID in the article document to facilitate "joins"

#only retrieve documents where expanded_url != None
